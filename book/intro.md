# CNN Train-the-Trainer Workshop

Welcome! Use the left sidebar to navigate. Each notebook installs its own dependencies and can run on Colab (GPU).

Total course time: ~3 hours.

## Purpose

The purpose of this jupyter book is twofold:

* A hands-on workshop to teach how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) work under the hood, and how to train them for image segmentation tasks.
* A set of materials for instructors to use in their own teaching, giving examples of classical lecture slides, flipped classroom lessons, and pair programming exercises.

## Prerequisites

* Basic Python experience, including Jupyter notebooks.
* Basic machine learning experience is helpful but not required.
