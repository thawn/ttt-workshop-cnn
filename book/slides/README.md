# Teaching Convolutional Neural Networks

## Slides for Classic Lecture

We start with a classic lecture introducing convolutional neural networks. The slides are implemented as a Jupyter notebook using the RISE extension to enable slide mode.

Slides are available for [download as PDF here](https://github.com/thawn/ttt-workshop-cnn/blob/main/book/slides/TTT_CNN.pdf).
