# Pair programming

In this session, you will work in pairs.

The teacher shuffles teams after each break.

## In Presence Instructions

Unlearn what you learned in school: Please talk to each other! This will be a bit noisy, but communication is key for this session!

### Finding teams

1. Starting at the person sitting at your left side of the classroom.
2. The first person that does not have a partner yet, chooses the person to their right as partner.
3. Repeat until everyone has a partner.
4. If people are left over, either sit next to other people that do not have a partner, or join the team to your left.

## Online Instructions

Create enough breakout rooms for half the number of participants. The teacher randomly re-asigns teams before each session.
